# Accelerating Cleantech Advancements through NLP-powered Text Mining and Knowledge Extraction
## From Exploratory Text Analysis to Large Language Models (LLMs) Applications

### Goals
This project aims to use NLP techniques to accelerate the process of text analysis, 
knowledge acquisition and innovation in the cleantech sector. NLP technology can play a crucial role in 
this area as it helps us to extract valuable insights from large amounts of text data. 

In this project, we start with exploratory text analysis including topic modeling to understand cleantech 
media and patent data. We then train word and sentence embedding models to better represent 
cleantech innovation content and develop a question answering and information retrieval system that 
can help stakeholders facilitate cleantech innovation. The goal of this project is threefold:  

- Advanced Text Analytics Mastery.
Expand applications of NLP techniques, including working with 
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for deeper text analytics and extracting insights from 
specialized media and patent texts.

- Cleantech Expertise and Innovation Acceleration.
Use the analysis of both patent and media 
datasets to gain a comprehensive understanding of the cleantech sector and conduct a comparative 
analysis to identify gaps between market trends and patented technologies and suggest areas for future 
innovation and research.  

- Better Communication and Collaboration. Foster the ability to summarize and present complex 
results and promote interdisciplinary collaboration across the cleantech ecosystem. 

### Datasets
To realize the goals of this project, we use two comprehensive datasets: 
1) The Cleantech Media Dataset, which consists of recent media articles and publications

2) The Cleantech Google Patent Dataset, which contains detailed information on cleantech-related patents.

This dual dataset approach provides a unique opportunity to apply NLP techniques to not only understand the current discourse in 
the cleantech industry, but also to explore the landscape of technological innovation and intellectual 
property. The main objective is to utilize advanced NLP methods to gain a deeper understanding and 
facilitate knowledge extraction from this rich textual data.
