## Contents of the Stage 2 file:

I. ReadMe File 
II. Team_7_Stage_2_Advanced Embeddings Models Training and Analysis_Word Embeddings.ipynb
	It contains the following: 
	- 1. Data preparation for word embeddings
	- 2. Word embedding training using Word2Vec
	- 4. Transfer learning with advanced open-source models FLAN-T5 and BART for word embeddings
III. Team_7_Stage_2_Advanced Embeddings Models Training and Analysis_Sentence Embeddings.ipynb
	It contains the following:
	- 1. Data preparation for sentence embeddings
	- 3. Sentence embedding training using averaged word vectors for sentence embeddings with GloVe and sentence embeddings with Doc2Vec (without averaging)
	- 4. Transfer learning with advanced open-source model Sentence-BERT for sentence embeddings

The "content" file on the main page contains all csv files and some trained models used in this work.

All visualizations, word/sentence similarity tasks, clusterings and visualizations are found in the notebooks. Furthermore, the two notebooks also contain 
explorations of thematic overlaps and differences between the two datasets and reports on insights.
